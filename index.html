                How should I even start this letter, or whatever this is. When I think about you, I can not pick a single moment that describes our relationship. We honestley have been through thick and thin, we have had eachothers back no matter what and I am truely grateful that I can say you are my sister. You have given up so many things just to make me happy, and you don't stop there. You constantly put others before yourslef and care about your friends and family before yourself. We are truely thankful for being able to know someone like you. Anyway I don't want to make this too long, I just wanted to say that I love you and I hope you have a great birthday.
            </p>
